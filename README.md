A positive destination for survivors of abuse

The "We Are Redwoods" project conveys a positive message to survivors of abuse. 

Survivors of abuse often have a poor self image as a
result of their experiences. We Are Redwoods was
created to inspire them with a different point of view.
The home page reads, “Redwoods are survivors of abuse
who grow above and beyond, and it’s not an uncommon
story. The Redwood seed needs a fire to be freed from its
shell—then they become the tallest trees in the world.”
Logo and color palette reflect a positive, welcoming
destination for survivors of abuse in contrast with
related websites that are depressing with images of
bruises and cuts.
