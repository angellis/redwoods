                <p>Jen&rsquo;s hell was an abusive alcoholic who lived off her income. When she tried to stand up to him, he punched her in the head so hard she didn’t remember. If she left, she knew he would put her on the list of people he planned to kill before he killed himself. She finally walked away after he pointed his gun at refugee kids. She’ll never know why he didn’t shoot her then.  </p>

                <h3>Jen</h3>
                <p>As Jen sat amid the wreckage of her life, an acquaintance insisted they get together. Laura, the capable head of a investment company told Jen the story of her own hell. Jen was dumbfound. How could the same thing happen to Laura, who was strong and confident? Laura explained that it was not unusual for accomplished people to have an abused history. She told Jen about other people with similar experiences and even more impressive accomplishments. </p>

                <p>Laura was the first of many people to tell Jen her story of survival and triumph. Jen&rsquo;s image of an abuse survivor, beaten down and broken, was replaced with these high achievers, these Redwoods. They were all around her embodying the message, &ldquo;You are not alone and your future is bright.&rdquo;</p>

I couldn&rsquo;t believe he wasn&rsquo;t following me. Then he was. Walking down a long driveway to the garage, I was sure he would shoot me in the back. I&rsquo;m still surprised I got away.
